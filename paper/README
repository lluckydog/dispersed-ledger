This directory holds data and Gnuplot scripts to produce the figures in the
paper.

.
├── avid-reduction
|	Theoretical comparison of AVID-M and AVID-FP.
├── geo-latency-new
|	Latency of DL and HB in the geo-distributed setting.
├── geo-progress
|	Sample trace of DL and HB demonstrating the decoupling idea of DL.
├── geo-thruput
|	Throughput comparison on the Vultr testbed, used in the appendix. *
├── latency-metric
|	Comparison of the two metrics for latency: all transactions, and local-
|	originated transactions only. Used in the appendix.
├── new-revision-geo-thruput
|	Throughput comparison on the AWS testbed, also includes DL-Coupled.
├── scalability-ratio
|	Scalability plot showing the fraction of data for VID.
├── scalability-thruput
|	Scalability plot showing throughput vs. cluster size.
├── synthetic-thruput-spatial
|	Controlled experiment with geo-varying bandwidth.
└── synthetic-thruput-variation
	Controlled experiment with time-varying bandwidth.

*: This dir also contains data on the AWS testbed, but the figure is not used
   in the final paper. Instead, we use the fig in new-revision-geo-thruput,
   which also includes DL-Coupled.
